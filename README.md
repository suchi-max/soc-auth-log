# SOC Authentication Log Analysis

## Objective
This project was created to demonstrate my understanding of how a SOC analyst monitors and analyzes Linux authentication logs to detect suspicious login activity. The focus is on identifying failed authentication attempts that may indicate brute-force attacks or unauthorized access attempts.

## What I Did
In this project, I worked with the Linux authentication log (auth.log) on an Ubuntu system. I analyzed the log entries to identify repeated failed login attempts and abnormal authentication behavior. Using standard Linux command-line tools, I filtered and reviewed these events to understand how real-world security incidents are detected at an early stage in a SOC environment.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Practical Linux log analysis from a security perspective  
- Understanding of authentication-related security events  
- Ability to identify potential security incidents  
- SOC-style documentation and reporting  
- Version control and professional project handling using Git and GitHub  

## Why This Matters for SOC Roles
Authentication logs are one of the most critical data sources monitored by Security Operations Centers. Failed login attempts are often the first sign of brute-force attacks, compromised credentials, or unauthorized access. This project reflects the type of initial investigation a SOC analyst performs during continuous monitoring and incident triage.

## Tools Used
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS  
- Bash (Linux command line)  
- grep for log filtering  
- Git and GitHub for version control
