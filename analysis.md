I intentionally attempted to run privileged commands using a user account that does not have sudo access in order to generate authentication and authorization failures. To investigate this activity, I checked the Linux authentication log file located at /var/log/auth.log, which records login attempts, sudo usage, and permission-related events. I used the command sudo grep "testusersuchi" /var/log/auth.log to filter and identify log entries related to the failed attempts. One example log entry showed that the user testusersuchi was not in the sudoers file and that the system denied the privilege escalation request. This log evidence proves that the operating system correctly detected, blocked, and recorded unauthorized privilege escalation attempts, which is a key indicator SOC analysts monitor for potential insider misuse or attacker activity.
